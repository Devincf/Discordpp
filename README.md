# Discord++

Discord++ is a wrapper for the discord websocket and rest api written in c++

# Features

  - Connect to the Discord Gateway and receive events

Planned:
  - Sending data through the REST-API
  - Send Webhooks to Discord
  - Ability to easily create commands


### Dependencies

Discord++ uses a number of different libraries to work properly:

* [Boost](https://boost.org) - Provides a set of support for various tasks especially used by the other libraries
* [Jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) - Json formatter for c++
* [Websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp) - Header only C++ library that implements RFC6455 The WebSocket Protocol.

Discord++ itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/Devincf/Discordpp.git) on GitHub.
